Please adhere to the following instructions for the continued development of the web application:

*   **Thorough Review:** Conduct a thorough and detailed review of both the project's source code and the web application itself (Use codebase investigator to only read as groups or parts of project if necessary).
*   **Continued Development:** Continue the development of the application, with a specific focus on implementing the functionality outlined in the technical documentation located at: `/Users/marseillosatrian/Downloads/HarborFflow_dotnet_Suite_Marseillo_v2/target_tech_spec_HarborFlow_dotnet_suite.md`.
*   **UI/UX Enhancement:** Focus on improving the application's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). This includes:
    *   Enhancing or adding new icons and background images.
    *   Improving or adding animations.
*   **Information Accuracy:** Ensure that all information displayed to the user is accurate and clearly communicates the application's intent.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Continuously identify and fix any problems or bugs within the application (If you Stuck in fixing bugs, please just note the bugs and continue work anything else, we will continue fixing its later!).

**Development and Debugging Workflow:**

*   **Always Use Chrome DevTools:** Throughout the development and debugging process, consistently use `chrome-devtools-mcp` to visit and review the web application running at `https://localhost:7163/`. This will prevent "blind" development, as `HarborFlow.Web` and `HarborFlow.Api` are running by me in other terminals (except when you tell me to stop).
*   **Login Credentials:** Use the following credentials for registration and login purposes:
    *   **Nama:** Marseillo
    *   **Email:** `rafaelbintang207@gmail.com`
    *   **Password:** `password123`
* **dotnet run --project HarborFlowSuite.Server --launch-profile https**
* **dotnet run --project HarborFlowSuite.Client --launch-profile https**
* **"DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=harborflowdb;Username=marseillosatrian;Password=bizero11"**
