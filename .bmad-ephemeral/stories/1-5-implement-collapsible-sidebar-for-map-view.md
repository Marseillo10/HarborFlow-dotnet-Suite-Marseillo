# Story 1.5: Implement Collapsible Sidebar for Map View

Status: in_progress

## Story

As a user,
I want to be able to collapse the main sidebar to have an immersive, full-screen map experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The sidebar can be collapsed and expanded with a single click.
2. The map content reflows to fill the available space.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Add a collapse/expand button to the sidebar.
- [ ] Task 2: Implement the logic to toggle the sidebar's visibility.
- [ ] Task 3: Ensure the map component resizes correctly when the sidebar is collapsed or expanded.
- [ ] Task 4: Write unit and integration tests for the collapsible sidebar functionality.

## Dev Notes

- The implementation will modify the main layout and the map component.
- State management will be needed to handle the sidebar's collapsed/expanded state.
